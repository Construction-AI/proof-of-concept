[DEVELOPMENT]
1. Enable real check on the existance of an index
2. Parse according to table of contents
    > take the full table
    > split by each part
    > recursively take each part, embbed and save
    > ...
    > label a given part accordingly

[PLANNING]
1. Pick the first kind of document to be generated based on "Inwentaryzacja"
2. Take it apart based on the table of contents 
3. Create a template with placeholders
4. Iterate over and over trying to generate such document based on data from "Inwentaryzacja" and template documents until satisfied

! Maybe create separate modules for each kind of document ATM - easy templating, prompting, etc.

[PRE-PLANNING]
1. Create directories with sample data and do a programmatical read on all of them, maintaining a clear divide between projects and splitting logically
